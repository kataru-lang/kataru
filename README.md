# Kataru 「カタル」 The minimal dialogue system written in Rust.

![rust workflow](https://github.com/katsutoshii/kataru/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

Kataru 「カタル」is a system for interactive dialogue based on YAML, parsed in Rust.

Kataru is similar to [Twine](http://twinery.org/) and [Yarn Spinner](http://yarnspinner.dev) except with more support for organizing passages and sharing common functionality across multiple characters.

```yml
---
# Define what namespace this file is in.
namespace: global

state:
  coffee: 0
  $passage.completed: 0

# Configure the scene. List your characters, commands, etc.
characters:
  May:
  June:

commands:
  Wait:
    duration: 0.3

  $character.SetAnimatorTrigger:
    clip: ""

onExit:
  set:
    $passage.completed +: 1
---
Start:
  - May: Welcome to my story!
  - June: Want a coffee?
  - choices:
      Yes: YesCoffee
      No: NoCoffee

YesCoffee:
  - May: Yeah, thanks!
  - set:
      $coffee +: 1
  - May.SetAnimatorTrigger: ["drinkcoffee"]
  - call: End

NoCoffee:
  - May: No thanks.
  - Wait: { duration: 1 }
  - June: Want to end this story?
  - call: End

End:
  - May: The end!
```
