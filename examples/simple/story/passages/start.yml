    Welcome to Kataru!
    「カタル」へようこそ！
    Kataru is a dialogue engine build compeltely on top of YAML with a focus on ease of implementation and simplicity of writing.
    This is an example of a multi-line narration line.
  - Alice: Hello, my name is Alice. This is how you write a dialogue line in Kataru!
  - Bob: Hi Alice, I'm Bob. Here is another line of dialogue. Isn't it nice how all character names are validated upon parsing?
  - Alice: It sure is, Bob!
  - Bob: Get ready though, soon you'll have to make a choice. Will you continue reading, or stop here?
  - choices:
      continue: ContinueReading
      stop: End

ContinueReading:
  - Alice: I'm so glad you chose to keep reading! Just for that, I'll go ahead and increase your charisma for you :)
  - set:
      charisma +=: 1
  - |
    Your charisma: ${charisma}
  - Bob: Uh oh, I think I hear a monster approaching! Reader, do you want to try fighting it?
  - choices:
      fight: TryToFight
      train: Train

  - if strength < 3:
      - |
        *training noises*
      - set:
          strength +=: 1
      - You trained and got stronger. You now have a strength score of ${strength}.
    else:
      - You've already trained too much!
  - What would you like to do now?
  - choices:
      continue training: Train
      try to fight: TryToFight

TryToFight:
  - You fight and fight and fight...
  - if strength > 2:
      - And you finally defeat the monster!
      - Congrats!
      - goto: End
    else:
      - But you weren't strong enough!
      - Should you try again?
      - choices:
          try again: TryToFight
          train: Train
